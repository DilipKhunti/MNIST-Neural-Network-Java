# Simple Neural Network in Java for MNIST Dataset

This repository contains a simple neural network implementation in Java, trained on the MNIST dataset. The network is designed to recognize handwritten digits, achieving this by calculating and adjusting weights and biases during training. The resulting weights and biases are stored in a log file for future use.

# Features
Neural Network Architecture: A basic neural network with configurable layers.
Training on MNIST Dataset: Uses the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits for training.
Weights and Biases Storage: After training, the calculated weights and biases are stored in a log file.
Java Implementation: The project is entirely written in Java, making it accessible for Java developers.
