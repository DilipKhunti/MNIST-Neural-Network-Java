# MNISTNeuralNetwork
This repository contains a simple neural network implementation in Java, trained on the MNIST dataset. The network is designed to recognize handwritten digits, achieving this by calculating and adjusting weights and biases during training. The resulting weights and biases are stored in a log file for future use.
